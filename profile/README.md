# AresOS ROM

Welcome to AresOS.

A personal project based on LineageOS 23.0 (Android 16) with needed non-gore features for POCO X4 GT / Redmi Note 11T Pro (+) / Redmi K50i (xaga - MT6895).

For additional information (about the features and more), you can either scout the available source code or visit [our website](https://chriscatto.gitlab.io/AresOS).

> Not buildable for other devices as a few things are private (this may change in the future).
