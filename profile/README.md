# AresOS ROM

Welcome to AresOS.

A personal project based on **LineageOS 23.0 / crDroid (Android 16)** with needed non-gore features for **POCO X4 GT / Redmi Note 11T Pro (+) / Redmi K50i (xaga - MT6895)** and **Oneplus Ace 5 / Oneplus 13R (giulia)**.

For additional information (about the features and more), you can either scout the available source code or visit [our website](https://chriscatto.gitlab.io/AresOS).

> **Not buildable for other devices as a few things are private (this may change in the future)**.
